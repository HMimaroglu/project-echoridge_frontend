## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
1. **Lint and Type Check**: Code quality validation
2. **Unit Tests**: Component and utility testing
3. **Build**: Application compilation

7. **Security Audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Test Reporting

- Accessibility violations reported and tracked

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Test Timeouts
- Increase timeout for slow operations
- Use `waitFor` for async operations
- Mock external dependencies
- Optimize test data size

#### Flaky Tests
- Identify race conditions
- Add proper wait conditions
- Stabilize test environment
- Use deterministic test data

#### Memory Issues
- Clean up after tests
- Avoid creating too many DOM elements
- Use shallow rendering where appropriate
- Monitor memory usage in CI

#### Browser Compatibility
- Test on actual devices when possible
- Use polyfills for missing features
- Implement progressive enhancement
- Provide fallbacks for unsupported features

## Best Practices

### Writing Tests
1. Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
2. Use descriptive test names
3. Test behavior, not implementation
4. Keep tests focused and small
5. Use proper mocking strategies
6. Include both happy path and error cases

### Maintaining Tests
1. Update tests when requirements change
2. Remove obsolete tests promptly
3. Refactor tests to reduce duplication
4. Keep test utilities up to date
5. Document complex test scenarios

### Performance Testing
1. Test on realistic network conditions
2. Include mobile device testing
3. Monitor Core Web Vitals consistently
4. Set up performance budgets
5. Test with realistic data volumes
